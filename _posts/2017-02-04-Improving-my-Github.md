    <td>I asked the teacher for instructions on how to import my Sheets into one of my blogs. I then revised what the teacher had said and I can now remember how to import Sheets into my Blog and so my revising strategies were effective.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on whether I include a colon or equals sign in my code so that my repository works well. I also need to learn when to include speech marks in my code.
Nothing in this lesson limited my learning.</td>

    <td>Next time I will add in some drop-down menus to make my Google Sheets look more interesting and maybe add some more videos into my blog. I have the same target as last lesson because this lesson I worked on nothing but Github and so I couldn't change anything in Google Sheets.</td>
