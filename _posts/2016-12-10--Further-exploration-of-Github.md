    <td>I listened to the teacher well enough to remember the structure of the code. This code created the tables, I also wrote down notes so that I didn't forget the structure.</td>

    <td>Nothing in this lesson limited my learning and I was able to work as quickly and effectively as the previous lessons.
I need to include more variety in my work such as a larger range of colours and I need to include more interesting features like the tables.</td>
