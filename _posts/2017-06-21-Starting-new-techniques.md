    <td>For the starter I managed to remember the len() function so that I was able to complete the task in the given time frame. My repository is very basic but I have learnt that by remembering little bits of code, I can improve my repository quickly and effectively. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing limited my learning this lesson as I was able to remember the basic code for the starter and improve my repository well. I just need to work on remembering the basics of python so that I am ready for future tasks involving this code (like I did today).</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should keep on revising python and review code that could help aid my repository for next lesson.</td>
