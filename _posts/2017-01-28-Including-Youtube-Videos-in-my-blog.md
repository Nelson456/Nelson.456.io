    <td>I was given a set of instructions to follow off the board and all I had to do was follow them successfully. Watching the tutorial more than once was effective because it meant that I remembered the steps and was able to check if I had made a mistake.</td>

I currently don't need to work on any particular habits.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try the extension, to add in a screenshot of my excel work so far, to show how I am improving in my coding. To improve my learning I could do some research about adding screenshots into blogs so that I come fully prepared next lesson.</td>
