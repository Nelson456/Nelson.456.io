  <tr>
    <td>I listened to the teacher during the demonstration and so I remembered the various steps of how to create the second part of my Virtual Shop. I requested assistance from one of my classmates when I got stuck and that helped me learn through my failures.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing in this lesson limited my learning and I was able to work as quickly and effectively as the previous lessons, apart from when I got stuck at one point.
I currently don't need to work on any particular habits.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will explore the software more and find out more interesting things about Microsoft Excel to improve my learning.
My Virtual Shop is working well and is now more interesting.</td>
